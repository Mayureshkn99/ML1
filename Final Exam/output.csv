Emily G.,"This place was amazing. Right off the start, the atmosphere when you walk in and down the stairs is hard to ignore. It's very spacious, so walks in perfectly fine, especially if you don't mind sitting at the bars! My boyfriend and I, both when for the pad Thai, and were completely blown away. Hands down our favourite Thai spot in the city. Portions are great size and delicious !",5
Nadine M.,"I've heard great things about Pai so I've been wanting to go. We had to wait for a while because it was a weekend but IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT. We loved everything we ordered and they were well-priced given the serving. I still can't stop thinking about the papaya salad and pork skewer--definitely order that when you go!If you go with friends, order (almost) everything on the menu and share so you can have a taste of every dish. I will definitely go back and won't stop raving about this restaurant!",5
Cathy C.,"Yelp Review 2023 #26:When in Toronto, you MUST come to Pai. If you're thinking whether to have lunch or dinner here, pick dinner as they have more items only served during dinner service.Certain regions of Thailand use certain ingredients. The southern part like their food spicier compared to the northern part. The popular dish in Northern Thailand is Khao Soi so, naturally, that's what I had to get.Khao Soi:A bowl of egg noodles in a golden coconut milk curry m with crispy noodles, coriander, green onions, and your choice of protein ((Braised Beef, Chicken Breast, Shrimp, Tofu & Veggies (contains shrimp paste), or Vegan)). I opted for chicken. They'll give you a side of chili, and lime to adjust the flavors. By itself, it's a little bit sweet. 4/5Pad Ga Prow:Rice dish with stir-fried holy basil with your choice of Ground Pork, Crispy Pork (Moo Grob), Chicken, Beef, Shrimp, or Tofu - topped with a fried egg. Served with nam prik nam pla sauce. Spice level of your choice (No Spice, Mild, Medium, Farang Spicy, or Thai Spicy). The crispy pork was the perfect choice. Man, I'm drooling as I'm reliving the moment I was eating this dish. 5/5Do make a reservation way ahead of time (a month ahead because Open Table will not let you make a reservation more than that). Once you are seated, they'll let you know you only have 90-120 minutes to eat. But stress not because the food comes out quick. So, my suggestion is to look up their menu before coming here and know what you want so you don't waste time trying to decide what you might be interested in. Also, they have multiple locations so, make sure you go to the right one.Due to their popularity, the service seemed rush. Not the best but not the worst.",4
Aya E.,"Ordered:Thai Chicken Wings - 1/2lb (~CAD$10): 4 fried chicken wings topped with crispy shallots, magrud lime leaves, and crispy chillies with a sweet tamarind saucePad See Ew with Chicken (~CAD$20): stir-fried hand-cut rice noodles with sweet soy sauce, Chinese broccoli, and eggChef Nuit Pad Thai with Beef (~CAD$20): red-flame stir-fried rice noodles in a house-made tamarind-palm sugar sauce with beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, long leaf coriander, shredded cabbage, fresh lime, and house-roasted peanuts; mild spiceThai Iced Tea (~CAD$20)Aya's take:When I tell you we (party of 2) waited a whole hour to eat here - I am not joking. For a Sunday evening, it was insanely busy and unfortunately you had to go in, put your name down, and then wait around to receive a text. Despite that, I'm here to tell you it was worth it! After an hour of staring at and salivating over the menu waiting for a table, we knew what to order right away. The Thai Chicken Wings were sticky, crispy, and aromatic. What a great way to start the meal. Both noodle dishes were phenomenal. The Pad See Ew was smokey, sweet, and fresh. The Pad Thai was loaded with beef and had an unbelievable depth of flavors. There was a tad too many beansprouts but overall, that wasn't too distracting. The Thai Iced Tea was sweet, creamy, and balanced out the spices and richness of the dishes. I completely understand the hype around Pai and why it was so busy on a Sunday night. My only complaint would be the wait time, but the food is well worth a visit!",4
Michelle D.,Back again at Pai!Got their pad gra prow with beef - thai spicy! and it was the perfect amount of almost uncomfortable spicy but still quite spicy. It was super flavourful and the portion was okay for the price. Also tried my friend's spring rolls and they were good. Service was great as usual. We came around 4pm on a weekday afternoon and were seated immediately so come early if you don't have a reservation or else you may be lining up outside.,4
Winnie H.,"Come back again for dinner. Very popular place and good vibes. The server is very efficient to serve. The dinner only allows 90 minutes per table. Once found you are almost done, he will deliver the bill ( that is only 60 minutes) .The Khao Sai is good. Its curry is very rich. Tom Yum Kung also has strong flavour and have 4 big shrimp in it. Only happen that the soup is not very hot even it is served under a small fire.",4
Angela T.,"Pai might have been the most recommended restaurant to us for our trip to Toronto, and it definitely lived up to the hype!My boyfriend and I came in on Saturday for lunch and we arrived right before a huge rush. They limit you 90 minutes to dine in, which is plenty of time given how quickly the kitchen pumps out dishes! Between the two of us, we ordered 5 wings to share, pad gra pow with crispy pork, and khao soi with shrimp. Wings - Not as crispy as advertised, but the sauce it came with was nice and sweet! Was still delicious, but nothing to rave about. Pad Gra Pow - ALL OF IT. YES. I couldn't stop eating this dish despite how full I was, but every component of this dish was perfection. The crispy pork gave the dish a little bit more bite and the fried egg was just perfection! We ordered it mild, but didn't taste any kick to it, so if you're a spice lover, definitely order it spicier. :)Khao Soi - The broth was creamy, coconutty, and very very fragrant. The noodles were cooked perfectly and still had a great bite to it. I loved the addition of the crispy noodles for a little extra texture. The broth was really rich and was the perfect soup for a chilly afternoon! Can't recommend Pai enough and definitely coming back for the next Toronto trip!",5
Christine T.,"Portions are small but flavors are good!We ordered:Pad Gra Prow, Panang Curry, Squash Fritters, Beef Curry and a few other dishes.I'd recommend coming early  to avoid the wait.",4
Heidi M.,"Sadly we did not get a chance to dine-in, due to a 1.5 hour wait, but we did order takeout.  There's a designated waiting area for takeout orders, which made the 30 minute wait acceptable.  We were told by locals to try the Khao Soi, which we had never tried or heard of before.  We were not led astray, because that was the BEST Thai dish I've tasted.  I wish we could have experienced it at the restaurant itself, but it was still out of this world!  I'm hoping the next time we're in Toronto, we'll get a chance to. The 4-stars is for not being able to review the service/dine-in experience, otherwise a 5-star.",4
Jeung P.,"SO and I stopped here for lunch and although it was a tad bit pricy, everything was prepared well.  We started off with the garlic shrimp, which were nice and flaky and came with a tasty sweet tamarind sauce.  SO had the beef noodle soup, which was perfect on a cold day, and I had the panang chicken, which was tasty and hit the spot. Bottom line, the service was fast and the food was tasty.  We'll probably venture to a different Thai restaurant just because there are so many of them that we haven't visited, but it's good to know that this place does Thai well.",4
